"""
Library with some objects that make use of the python Turtle library to show graphics of a discrete event simulation of an MM1 queue (random arrivals and services, a single server).

There are various objects that allow for the simulation and demonstration of emergent behaviour:

- Player (I use the term player instead of customer as I also allow for the selfish and optimal behaviour: graphical representation: blue coloured dot);
- SelfishPlayer (inherited from Player: when passed a value of service, a SelfishPlayer will join the queue if and only if it is in their selfish interest: graphical representation: red coloured dot.);
- OptimalPlayer (uses a result from Naor to ensure that the mean cost is reduced: graphical representation: gold coloured dot.)

- Queue
- Server

- Sim (this is the main object that generates all other objects as required).
