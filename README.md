# Overview

This repo currently contains two things:

- A basic event driven MM1 queue simulation (that would be nice if someone turned in to an MMC queue). This was used in a screencast (link below).
- A more complicated clock based simulation of an MM1 queue that also allows for the investigation of selfish and social behaviours (currently this is all linked to Naor's 1969 paper). Importantly, this also contains a graphical element: allowing for the visualisation of the queue using the Turtle library.

## Basic event driven MM1 queue

This is some short code that can be used to simulate an *MM1* queue (a queue with Markovian inter-arrival and service rates and 1 server). The code is used in a short video [Simulating a Queue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEA8m3j-Jqk) describing a basic approach to simulating a queue.

If people would like to mess around with this code please do!

If people are interested in discrete event simulation within python I know that a library called [SimPy](http://simpy.sourceforge.net/) (unfortunate name re SymPy) exists but I've never used it.
